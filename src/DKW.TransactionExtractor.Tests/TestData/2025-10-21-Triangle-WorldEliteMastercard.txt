If we do not receive the minimum payment due by the due date, the amount of your equal payments plan instalment(s) 
that is unpaid will no longer form part of the equal payments plan. We'll charge you interest on that amount at your 
applicable regular annual interest rate of 21.99% from the day after your next statement date. However, if you've already 
received a notice that your applicable regular annual interest rate will increase on that date, the higher interest rate will 
apply.
